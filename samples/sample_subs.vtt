00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.903
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.640
Welcome to the
second of four

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.977
Psychology Department
Speakers Series this year,

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.946
the second one
of this semester.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:16.816
It is my pleasure to introduce
to you Dr. Sarah Domoff.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:19.953
Dr. Domoff is a
clinical psychologist

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.189
and a professor at Central
Michigan University.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.692
Dr. Domoff did her
undergraduate degree

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.627
at the University
of Connecticut.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.763
Her PhD is from
Bowling Green,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.400
and she did her postdoc at
the University of Michigan.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.068
I believe I forgot
to introduce myself--

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.069
I'm Dr. Frank Connor.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.004
I'm the Chair of the
Psychology Department.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.274
I'm sort of irrelevant, other
than getting this set up, but--

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.411
so, if you would, please
welcome today's speaker.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.578
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
(applause)

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.113
Can you guys hear me okay?
(applause)

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.782
Everyone hear
me okay?

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.183
Well, thank you so
much for having me.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.184
I'm really excited
to be here.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.953
It's my first time on campus,
and it's beautiful.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.889
I ate at The Heritage Restaurant
and that was awesome,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.092
so thank you again
for having me.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.060
So, today, the
title of my talk

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.663
is "Child Development
in the Digital Age--

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.169
"How, and for Whom, Does Mobile
Media Use Become Problematic?"

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.403
So, just to kind
of orient you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.405
to what I'll be
speaking about today--

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:16.976
this is a really big topic--
so the objectives I have.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:19.479
I would hope that you leave
here with an understanding

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.315
of how screen media
and mobile device use

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.084
may impact child
social-emotional development

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.352
and academic
achievement.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.655
And just to define two terms,
when I say "screen media,"

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.324
I mean media delivered
through a screen,

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:36.362
so not magazines or books,
but laptops, computers,

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.164
TV, video games.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.067
And then, "mobile device use"
refers to smartphones

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.969
and tablets.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.005
Secondly, I'd love for you
to be able to leave here

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.874
with the ability
to think about

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.777
and distinguish between
normative, or typical,

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:55.415
versus problematic use of
screen media during childhood.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.793
So, as you all probably know,
we live in a digital age.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.330
Teenagers, 13
to 18 years old,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:14.901
average 9 hours of
screen media use per day.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.136
This is a lot.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.006
And children,
8 to 12 years old,

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:24.711
use approximately 6 hours
of screen media per day.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.212
And we're seeing
that not only

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.315
is the amount of screen time
increasing for youth,

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.417
we're seeing that
children at younger ages

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.888
are getting access
to mobiles devices

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:40.059
and access to more opportunities
to view screen media.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.262
Now, in 2013,
about 40% of families

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.465
with children
years 8 and under

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.334
owned tablet
devices.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.638
But more recently, we've
found that by age 4,

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:57.010
nearly 75% of children
owned their own mobile device.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.712
And I believe recent
research just came out

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.881
stating that that
number was higher for--

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.418
thinking about families with
children 8 years and younger,

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.954
most of them have access to
a mobile device of some sort,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.824
including a tablet or their
own, like, a smartphone.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.961
So, screen time
media use is growing

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.497
and children at younger
ages are getting access

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.600
to their own
mobile devices.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.801
Now, in terms
of my research,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.204
a lot of my work focuses on
diverse children's use of media,

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.440
so children from
lower-income backgrounds,

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.075
racially/ethnically
diverse children,

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.477
and how they
use media.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.946
And we know that
low-income children

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.447
and racially/ethnically
diverse children

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.549
have the highest
amounts of screen time,

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.850
and this is especially
problematic

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:41.120
given the negative
correlates of screen time.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.156
Specifically, black youth
use screen media an average

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:47.126
of 2.5 hours more than
their white peers...

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.695
and lower-income teens
spend an average

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.297
of 3 hours more
using screen media

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.267
than their higher-income
teens-- uh, peers.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.369
So we're seeing
disparities

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.972
in how much children
use screen media,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.941
and if this was all pro-social
and educational media,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.177
you probably wouldn't
have me here today.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:08.448
&gt;&gt; Excuse me, is that per day?
&gt;&gt; Yes, mmm-hmm.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.250
Feel free to jump
in with questions.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.419
Now, it's not just
kids and teens.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:18.558
We also use our
devices a lot, right?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.493
Adults in the US
spend over 10 hours

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.696
using screen media
per day,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.165
and children are potentially
affected by this.

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:27.667
We have-- over half
of children report

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.738
that their parents check
their devices too often.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.409
32% of children report
that they feel unimportant

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.579
when their parents get
distracted by the phone.

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:43.349
One of my collaborators
at U of M

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.284
did this really
interesting study,

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.320
looking at how families
use mobile devices

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.957
in fast-food restaurants
in the Boston area,

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.992
and she found that
70% of adults

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.294
use mobile devices
during meals.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:59.632
And later research has shown
that children are more--

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.634
engage in more
disruptive behaviors

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.102
when their parents
are on mobile devices,

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.138
potentially to get
their attention...

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.406
and parents are more
quick to respond

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.841
with anger or frustration
to those children

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.944
when they're on or
preoccupied with their phones.

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.179
So this is really
raising some questions

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.215
about what does this
media use look like

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.684
and what implications
does this have

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.487
for family interactions, for
parent-child interactions,

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.223
for family
relationships?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.295
The first study I'll
be presenting on

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.331
seeks to answer some
of these questions.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.767
We know that children are
using screen media a lot.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.803
Parents are.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.439
Children at younger ages
are using mobile devices.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:40.973
But what does this
look like actually--

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.375
what does this actually
look like in the households?

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:46.179
What do families-- how do
families use screen media,

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.814
mobile media?

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.552
Research on this and different
theories have been supported

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.387
looking at how
parental mediation,

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.089
or how parents manage
and talk to children

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.024
about their media use
can be really important

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:01.494
and can buffer against the
negative effects of media.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.764
Does this still occur
in today's digital age?

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.667
Let me dive a little bit
more into parental mediation

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.102
because this is
really important.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.604
There a lot of focus on the
negative effects of media,

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.307
but there's also this
protective factor here,

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.042
the role that
parents have

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.078
in reducing exposure to
certain types of media

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.079
and explaining
to children

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.049
what they're seeing
on television.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:27.120
We know that children whose
parents use parental mediation

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.589
have fewer negative
effects of media use,

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:30.790
and that happens
through different types

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:34.193
of parental mediation, which
I'll briefly explain right now.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.629
"Social co-viewing" just means
having a parent present

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:40.433
with a child,
watching TV or media.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.368
"Restrictive mediation"
means setting limits.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.870
Parents can set limits on
what their children see

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:47.640
in terms of content and for
how long they use media.

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.243
And then, "active mediation"
is the really good stuff,

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.111
what we want all
children to experience

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.746
and that's having
a parent present,

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.715
explaining the content
that they're seeing,

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.318
labeling character
behaviors as good or bad,

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.287
explaining the motivations
behind characters,

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.889
and really inserting
the family's values

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.625
into what they're
seeing on TV,

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.695
to really put that into
a context for the child.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.931
So, parental mediation
can be really wonderful

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.534
and is necessary--
yeah?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.838
&gt;&gt; Are these studies at all done
in correlation with schools

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.706
and how schools
use the media?

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.275
&gt;&gt; Not yet.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.676
So these are-- a
lot of the research--

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.077
&gt;&gt; These are just home?
&gt;&gt; These--

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:28.247
a lot of this is based
on parent report of use--

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.617
children's use
at home, correct.

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.387
We don't know much about
what parental mediation

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:37.890
looks like today, in our
digital environments.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.359
We have some ideas of
how parents manage

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:43.796
internet exposure, but we
still have a lot to learn.

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:48.100
And so, that's where
this study one comes in.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.036
We know that research
has been focused

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:53.339
on mediation of TV use
and video games.

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:57.176
And again, this is primarily
through self-report,

00:07:57.243 --> 00:08:00.246
but we don't know what it looks
like in real-time in households.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.414
And so, the aims
of this study,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.416
this first study
I'll present to you,

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:06.152
include using
observational methods,

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:11.791
actually witnessing how
children use media in the home

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:16.395
and how parents mediate, or
do not mediate, their content.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.865
And then, identify
themes of measured

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.534
parent-child interactions
around media use

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.637
that are salient
in this digital age.

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.339
So, like I said,
we have research

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.709
on how parental mediation
works for TV exposure,

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.745
but does it still occur
to the same degree

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.980
for other
types of media?

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.147
And what's it look
like right now

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:38.784
in households in
the United States?

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.553
So, in this study, it was
an observational study.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.721
I'll get into
the methods

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:45.658
of how we captured household
media use in a second.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.059
So, it was a
smaller sample.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:50.263
We had toddlers
and preschoolers

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:52.298
and approximately
50% were male.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.502
A majority were
non-Hispanic white families.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.304
And most mothers in
the study reported

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.674
having a high school
degree or higher.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:06.913
This is what I'm really excited
to share with you today.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.248
Has anyone heard of the
Language Environment Analysis,

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.918
or LENA,
technology?

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.754
It's really,
really cool.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.323
So, it audio records
the home environment

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.525
to provide a deeper
understanding of contextual

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.827
and parent-child
interaction factors

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.397
potentially salient
to media use.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.800
So, children in our
study wore the device.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.735
It's right there on the
bottom of your screen,

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:32.138
and little kids put it
in a shirt that they--

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.408
they're designed to hold
the recording device.

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:38.411
And they wore it for
a couple days at home,

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:42.381
and it recorded all things
in their environment.

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.784
Now, what's really
cool about LENA

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.052
for people that,
like me,

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.087
that study technology
and media use

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:52.091
is that it tells us when in
the hour of the recording

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.527
an electronic media
signal is present.

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:58.197
So, we can isolate segments
of the audio environment

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.533
that have
media present,

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:03.669
and we can transcribe
or look more deeply

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.539
at what's happening
when TV is on,

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:10.977
what's happening when there's
electronic media that's audible.

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.778
And so, that's
exactly what we did.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.680
&gt;&gt; Could you explain--
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.183
&gt;&gt; The different bars, what
the different colors mean?

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:21.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the yellow
indicates the presence

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.689
of electronic media.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.992
&gt;&gt; And so, that's what I
was really interested in.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.927
There's other types of
codes that they have

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.829
for different types of
things in the environment

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.198
based on acoustic
signaling.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:33.833
I was focused on
the yellow bars,

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:36.035
finding those hours when
we had media present

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:39.038
because I want to know how do,
if at all, parents talk

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.906
to their children about
what they're seeing.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.209
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; On TV or any
other type of device

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.746
that provides audible
electronic media.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.180
So, what we did,
we got a lot of data,

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.082
so we focused on
the first hour

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.151
in which a media
signal was present,

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.821
and we transcribed
parent-child communication

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:59.225
about media during
that segment.

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.894
These transcripts of
parent-child verbal interactions

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.530
were reviewed by
cross-disciplinary experts--

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:08.267
so people in-- somebody
from communication studies,

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.835
developmental behavioral
pediatrician,

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:13.239
and clinical psychologist--
reviewed the transcripts

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:18.277
and identified themes of
interactions around media use.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:23.215
So I wanted to present to you
the four themes that emerged.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:27.486
What did we actually
see in these homes?

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:31.557
So, as I mentioned, parental
mediation is really important.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.626
And I talked to you about
some different types--

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.462
active mediation
being wonderful,

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.631
restrictive mediation,
and social co-viewing.

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:42.635
What we heard and what we
read in the transcripts

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:46.105
was that parental mediation
was primarily restrictive.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.707
It was tech-focused, meaning
a lot of it was focused

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:50.810
on HOW to use
technology,

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:54.914
not really the content of
what the child was viewing.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.849
So, to give you
some examples.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.784
We have a mother
saying to her toddler,

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.219
"No no pressing
buttons now.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.921
"Just talk to Nana,"
regarding a child

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:05.691
talking on the phone
with Grandmother.

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:06.826
"Come on, give
me the phone.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.961
"Play a game," on
the mother's phone.

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.030
"Push next-- I'm gonna
tell you how to play."

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.965
So it was really focused--
the communication around media

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:16.635
was focused on instructing
the child to use the device

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:22.308
and not so much about what the
child was seeing on the devices.

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:25.344
Does that
make sense?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.612
How to use
the phones

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:29.415
and different ways that we
charge a phone, for example.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.484
So mother would say,
"Okay, someone needs

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.585
"to plug the
phone in."

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.887
"It is
plugged in!"

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:36.522
"You have to jiggle
it a little.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.257
"It vibrates, that means
that it's plugged in."

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:42.128
So helping children learn about
how to use mobile devices,

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.430
but not so much what
we've studied before,

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:47.766
about talking about
what they're seeing

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.935
on the mobile
devices.

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:54.373
So, in some, parental mediation
was primarily restrictive,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.875
so setting
limits on use,

00:12:55.941 --> 00:13:00.112
and focus on using--
actually using the technology,

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:04.016
versus talking
about the content.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:07.686
Now, when we did hear
active mediation,

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.088
though it was uncommon,
when we did hear it,

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:14.260
it was because the child
asked for it or elicited it.

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:15.794
Typically, when we study
parental mediation,

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:18.097
we think about the parent
kind of proactively saying,

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.298
"Okay," sit down
with the child,

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.433
and, "This is how-- this
is what you're seeing

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.536
"on TV or
whatnot."

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:26.839
In our research, we found that
it was more often the child

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.842
that was asking the parent
to join in with them

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.544
in their
digital world.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.647
So, for example, a child
said, "What happened?"

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.849
in response to a scene in
"James and the Giant Peach"

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.817
and the mother
explained what happened.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.819
So that's kind of part of
this active mediation piece,

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.589
but it's a child
bringing it about.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.126
A child saying,
"I can't watch this one,"

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.628
and the mother asking,
"Is it scary?"

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.297
"Uh-huh."
"Oh."

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.865
"I don't like
the villain."

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.234
So, these may seem like
pretty simple statements,

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.802
but, really, what it's
showing is that children

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:59.371
are trying to get more
parental interaction

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:02.608
around their media use,
what they're seeing,

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.277
and they're
eliciting it.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.349
Now, it probably doesn't come
as a surprise to most of you,

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:12.084
but we heard a lot
of negotiation

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:16.755
between parents and
children about screen time.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.558
So, for example,
we had one interaction,

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.093
a mother saying-- okay,
trying to set limits--

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.795
"You get five
minutes of TV.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.564
"It's too late
already today."

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.467
And the child saying, "I want
to watch TV for 10 minutes."

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.603
"No."
"What about nine minutes?"

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.638
(audience laughing)
"No."

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.407
"Can I watch-- can
I play on my iPad?"

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.576
What do you guys think?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:40.479
&gt;&gt; "Yes, you may
play on the iPad."

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.281
Isn't that
something?

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.617
And the child spends
time on the iPad,

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.086
and it's not
watching pro-social

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.021
or educational media
in this example.

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.757
It was actually a
glorified advertisement.

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:53.158
So, you know,
think about that

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:56.862
and how parents perceive,
or may perceive,

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:00.232
mobile technology
and its benefits.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:03.235
When, if you're not seeing what
the child is actually viewing,

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:06.772
what they could be
exposed to, right?

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.141
So, that was
the third theme.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.442
When we did hear
this back and forth,

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.011
it wasn't processing
content,

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.779
it was, "I want
to get more time,"

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:17.850
or, "Can you give me
this mobile device?"

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.321
What I think is really
kind of descriptive

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:26.358
of what at least a households
we observed look like

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:30.629
was what we're calling
"parallel family media use."

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.831
So, we observed
children being exposed

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:36.368
to multiple types of
screen media in the home,

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.871
with devices being
used at the same time

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:41.774
by different family members
across all the age groups.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.275
So this is--
you know, a reminder,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:47.513
this is including children
as young as 1 year of age.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.883
So, examples of this type
of parallel family media use

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:53.585
include preschool-aged
children were exposed

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.854
to other family members
using their own devices

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:58.123
while they independently
viewed media.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.092
So we heard siblings
use separate devices

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.393
at the same time.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.863
So it's this concept
of "together alone."

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.868
They're together, but they're
not present with the same media.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:12.604
What is of great concern
to clinical psychologists,

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.375
people that study a child's
academic functioning

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:19.345
and what can get in the
way of success in school,

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:22.081
is what we saw around
media multitasking

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.382
and I'll define
what that is.

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:25.250
I'm gonna give you some more
examples of the negative impact

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:28.020
of media multitasking
in a few slides.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:31.890
We often heard TV on
in the background

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:35.461
while children and their parents
were using mobile devices.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:39.998
So children at young ages
are media multitaskers.

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:44.036
They are playing with a
device and watching TV,

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.738
using multiple media
at the same time.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.473
Media multitasking.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.741
And this is
really concerning,

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:51.543
because we know that that
has negative associations

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.512
with a variety of
cognitive outcomes

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.714
for at least adolescents
and young adults.

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:57.216
This is showing that
this needs to be studied

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.385
at younger ages, 'cause
it's happening today

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.620
with younger
children.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:08.093
So, this observational study
gives us some evidence

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.496
that there are
changing practices

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.598
in how families
use media.

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:14.700
Now, granted, this
was a small study.

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.136
We definitely hope that
this encourages people

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:20.239
to do larger-scale studies,
using surveys if they can,

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:22.274
to capture some of the
things that we saw here

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.876
to see how
widespread it is,

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.544
predictors of this type
of use in the home,

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:29.648
and what that means for
the child's development.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.550
We did hear a
limited amount

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.686
of parent-child engagement
around media use.

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:37.222
When it did occur, it was
because the child asked for it

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:40.292
and the child
got it to happen.

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:43.262
We actually also heard siblings
mediating the content

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.431
for their
younger siblings.

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:48.333
And so, siblings may be
playing an even greater role

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.404
in media management in
the households, today.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.542
Multiple media mobile
devices may challenge

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.577
parental
mediation efforts.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:03.816
So, it's really hard to mediate
content that you can't see

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.350
when you're-- if you're on
your phone across the room

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.019
and your child's
on the tablet.

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:09.855
So it's really challenging
parental efforts

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:14.993
to manage and talk about
what the child is seeing.

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:22.868
Thinking about what the media
use was like in these homes,

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:26.705
it made me wonder if I
were to call a family up

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:30.642
and ask them how many hours they
used screen media that day,

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:33.045
I don't know if they'd be
able to tell me accurately

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:34.446
because if most of
the family members

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.248
are using
their own media,

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.485
how can you report on
your child's media use

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.353
if you're
using media?

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.324
You know, it was just really
remarkable how much media

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.226
and different types of
media were being used

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.961
that it's really
gonna necessitate us

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:51.096
using things like
passive sensing

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.831
which automatically
captures

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.200
what people are doing
on their phones...

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.969
and can give that
information to researchers

00:18:57.035 --> 00:19:01.406
to capture that amount of
use and what type of use.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.242
And in one of my
future studies,

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:06.411
we will be using an
app to capture this

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.813
on adolescents'
phones,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.549
so that way, we won't be
as reliant on self-reports.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.750
Yeah, quick question?
&gt;&gt; One question, though.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.952
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When the children
wore the device

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.355
in your study, of the
interaction between parents

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.924
and the child during
their media use,

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.326
does that take into
account, like, the context

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.161
of what they're
watching?

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.898
Like, if some was
informational

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.500
and you don't have to interact
with the kids as much

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:31.603
because it is a teaching
video or something,

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.872
compared to
watching a movie

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.674
where you kind of need
to explain what's going.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.776
Do you all take that into
account in your studies?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.846
We did not take into
account the content,

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.080
but I do want to emphasize

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:45.484
that even if it's pro-social
or educational media,

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.886
we do want parents present
with that child, one-to-one,

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.054
talking to them about
what they're seeing

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.123
because kids
retain information

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.893
from positive media like that
or instructional media better

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.396
when they have an adult
scaffolding the content

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:59.097
and talking to
them about it.

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:02.000
So, even though
it's better content,

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:04.803
we still would highly encourage
parents, and teachers,

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.073
to be present with that child,
processing the content.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.509
That's a great
question, though.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.578
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; You might have
said it already,

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.813
what was the length
for the study,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.715
as far as time of
listening to it?

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.183
&gt;&gt; So, it was just
the first hour

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.651
in which a media
signal was present.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:24.423
&gt;&gt; Okay, and then, also
what level of information

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.325
was given to the parents
prior to this test?

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.027
Just, obviously, like,
the bias in knowing

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:32.030
that they're being, or what
level did they know the input?

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:35.634
&gt;&gt; That we were going
to observe and listen

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.870
to whatever was in their
child's environment.

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.572
So, it's been coded
for other types

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.675
of how children are
communicated to

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:47.846
about different types
of things besides media.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:51.149
Parents had the
option to not submit--

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.719
obviously, they could decline
participating in this

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.687
and not share
certain segments

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:59.558
if they don't want
us to hear them, so.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.059
But yeah, I think you
bring up some good points

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:03.261
about the
observer effect.

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.864
Like, how you make--
great point.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.033
So there are
limitations, obviously.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.168
The goal with this type of
research is just to try

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:13.505
to describe a new
phenomenon in our society,

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:17.342
and encourage other people
out there to study this,

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:20.379
to quantify it across
the population.

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.414
We definitely want,
I'm really interested

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.984
in how often this family
parallel media use is happening,

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:29.254
and what impact that has on
how parents and children

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.856
interact with
each other,

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:35.494
and their relationships, and
the child's social development.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.828
That's definitely
to come.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:37.829
I'll take any
other question

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:41.233
before I move onto my
conceptual framework.

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:43.835
&gt;&gt; So, parents were told
that they were observing

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:46.705
the media use...
&gt;&gt; Correct, correct.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:48.974
&gt;&gt; Okay, so parents
could monitor that.

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:52.044
Obviously, if you were told
that you were being monitored--

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.312
&gt;&gt; Yep, so--
&gt;&gt; They could use less?

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:55.881
&gt;&gt; Say that one more time?
&gt;&gt; Because you said

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.816
it was
self-reporting.

00:21:57.883 --> 00:22:02.187
&gt;&gt; So, the parent-- so the
children wore the device all day

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:04.389
in the home.

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:08.126
So, they had-- the parents knew
that the child was recording

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.895
what was in their environment.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.730
&gt;&gt; But it wasn't
like we told them,

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:14.332
"We're gonna look for when
you talk to them about this,"

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:17.235
or, "We're gonna see how you
talk about feeding practices."

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:22.274
We didn't tell them specifically
what we would be transcribing.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.275
Does that answer
your question?

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.711
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome.

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:29.081
So, I want to just
present this to you

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:33.351
to give you a kind of a dive
into how I think about

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:34.786
and study children's
media use.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:37.489
So, we know there's a lot
more screen time today

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.091
than there was when
we were younger,

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.826
that children at younger
ages are gaining access

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:44.463
to mobile devices, and family
dynamics around media use

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.398
have been
changing.

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:49.434
So, what does that mean
for a child's development?

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:50.736
There are three
different mechanisms

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:55.340
that have been studied, and
that I'm interested in studying,

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:58.076
looking at how does actual
media use in children

00:22:58.143 --> 00:23:00.245
affect their
development?

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.781
And there's three different
mechanisms or processes.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.084
The first one is called
"time displacement."

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:09.488
So if children are
spending time watching TV,

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.156
they're not spending time
doing something else

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.391
that could be good
for their development.

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:15.560
So, if they spend most of
their time playing video games

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:18.497
that's not multiplayer-- just
single-player video games--

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:22.400
they're not spending time
socializing with other peers.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.669
So, it's this idea of, we
take time away from something

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:28.607
that could be beneficial
to the child.

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:31.543
What I've been seeing a
lot more in the research,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.112
and the two mechanisms
that I look at

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:38.150
specific to how media use
affects a child's health

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.185
and their
well-being

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.286
are these bottom
two mechanisms,

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:44.089
and I'll talk about those
more in-depth later.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.424
So, one is that
it's not so much

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:49.728
how much time children use
media, but what they see.

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:50.896
So the content.

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:54.199
Content matters.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:57.035
And the second is interference
with other contextual behaviors.

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.004
So, with
mobile devices,

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.540
viewing media through
your mobile device,

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:02.874
you can take
that anywhere,

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:06.578
and when you use the mobile
device, when you view media,

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:10.649
can matter maybe more so
than how much time you spend

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.017
with that media.

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.452
And I'll tell you what
I mean in just a second.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:17.455
So, in terms of content, many
of you have probably heard

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:20.725
about how viewing violent
content can influence

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:23.562
antisocial and aggressive
behavior in children.

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:24.996
We also see negative
associations

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:28.700
between viewing violent content
and school achievement.

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:33.772
We see that viewing violent
content or aggressive content

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.607
can negatively influence
executive function,

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:40.078
especially ability to focus
and sustain attention.

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.914
So, there's a lot of research
on how content matters.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:48.820
This is true for viewing
sexually-explicit media.

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:51.656
Viewing commercials can have
a negative impact on children

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.158
because it makes
them want and desire

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:56.761
or request those things that
are advertised, like fast food.

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:57.762
But I do want
to point out

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.397
and I do focus a
lot on the negative,

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:02.033
but I should point out that
we see positive outcomes

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.037
for positive content,
so content matters.

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:08.240
Educational programming
for preschoolers

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:10.508
can have a positive impact
on cognitive development,

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.510
including vocabulary,
literacy,

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.446
social behavior,
academic knowledge.

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:18.383
And so, programs like
"Sesame Street" or "Mr. Rogers,"

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.886
those are pro-social
educational programs

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:22.554
that have been
developed by people

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:24.522
that know about
child development

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:28.460
and how to promote these
positive things for kids.

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:35.867
So, content matters in
both good and bad ways.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:38.670
What a lot of my next
studies will be focusing on

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:43.675
is how and when children
and adolescents use media.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:44.676
The context.

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:46.878
The context of
media use matters.

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.179
I want to focus
on bedtime

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:51.116
because that's gonna be one of
my big projects next semester

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:52.284
in our "Tech and
Teen" study.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.487
We're going to be looking at how
adolescents use mobile devices

00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:58.189
after bed, and if that
affects their sleep,

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:00.525
and their functioning
the next day...

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:03.728
using passive sensing,
so automatically tracking

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.597
what they do on
their mobile devices.

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:08.099
What we do know
from prior research

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.968
is that having a
television in the bedroom

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:13.138
is a major
health risk.

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:14.839
It predicts increased
obesity risk,

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.908
beyond overall
TV viewing time,

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:19.911
so, again, the
context matters.

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:24.249
Screen media use around
bedtime may stimulate children,

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:28.653
especially if the content
is fast-paced or violent,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.555
which has also been
found to associate

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:33.191
with greater sleep problems
in preschoolers.

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.660
And what do sleep problems
look like in kids

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:38.096
when they go
to school?

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:39.364
What do those
kids look like,

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:42.634
kids that don't
get enough sleep?

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:45.971
Hyper, hyperactive,
impulsive.

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:49.941
So we have-- sleep is so
important for everything, right?

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.910
And so, media use
around bedtime,

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.980
the context of when
you view media matters

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:57.582
for a child's
development.

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:00.218
We know that shorter sleep
duration is associated

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:03.421
with metabolic
disturbances.

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:05.490
And sleep deprivation
has been associated

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:08.126
with increased desire
for high-calorie foods,

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:11.196
along with decreased activity
in the frontal cortex

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:13.531
and insular cortex
regions of the brain,

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:16.534
responsible for
evaluating hunger.

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:17.802
So, I don't know if you
all have experienced this,

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:18.803
when you don't
get enough sleep,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.740
the next day, you
want to eat junk food

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:24.242
or you may not feel
as full as you would

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.477
if you had
enough sleep,

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:29.080
so you're seeing
media use especially

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:32.584
with its impact on sleep
being a big mechanism

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.822
linking screen time to
child health and development.

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.091
And it's not
just bedtime.

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:42.694
Think about any context
that's important

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:46.031
for child development
and child functioning.

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:49.100
Think about
academic-related time.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.503
We see a negative effect
on academic outcomes

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.738
when youth use media
or mobile devices

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:56.241
when learning
or studying.

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:58.510
We have a majority
of college students

00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.844
report using
electronic media

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:02.213
while in class, studying,
doing homework.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.316
That sound about right?
&gt;&gt; Mmm-hmm.

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:09.421
&gt;&gt; And this may begin as
early as 5 to 8 years of age.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:12.357
And many children have to
deal with background TV,

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.359
background media, while
working on homework

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.194
which has been shown
to slow them down

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.530
and decrease
accuracy.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.898
And then, media
multitasking,

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:24.335
which I reported to you as being
common even in younger children,

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.104
has been found to be
negatively associated

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:29.674
with older
students' GPA.

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:33.344
So, again, the theme of it's
not how much necessarily,

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:35.847
but WHEN children
are using media

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:39.684
that may have an impact on
their health and development.

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:43.388
I want to talk a little bit
more about media multitasking.

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:48.059
This is common-- about of
the 8 hours youth use, that--

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:52.931
of the 8 hours that youth use,
using screen media per day,

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:57.202
29% of the time involves
media multitasking.

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.870
So heavy media
multitaskers,

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:02.740
those to watch and use multiple
media at the same time a lot,

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:05.243
show differences in
their cognitive abilities.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.811
So, this is important
for people like me

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.646
who do testing
and assessment

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:15.153
of what may be causing problems
in academic success.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.124
Heavy media multitaskers often
have poor working memory,

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.726
poor interference
management.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:26.064
They have difficulty on tasks
requiring sustained attention,

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.766
and they underperform on tests
of relational reasoning,

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:31.469
inhibitory control,
and long-term memory.

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:34.205
So, basically, it's
not just how much,

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:38.843
but it's how youth use
media, when they use it,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.379
that can have an impact
on different outcomes

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:42.380
for them, right?

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.282
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Just a clarification, here.

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:47.585
You're looking at a-- so
having media multitaskers

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:50.288
is identified as a population?
&gt;&gt; Mmm-hmm.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.223
&gt;&gt; And then, you're
using that population

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.393
and giving them independent
assessments outside of media use

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.229
and comparing them to a
low media use population?

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:00.398
&gt;&gt; Mmm-hmm, yep.
&gt;&gt; And so, these results are--

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.067
have nothing to do with
the technology itself?

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.202
&gt;&gt; Mmm-hmm.
&gt;&gt; It has to do

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:06.638
with that relationship
between that population?

00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:08.907
&gt;&gt; Exactly-- does that
make sense to everyone?

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.341
Yeah.

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:17.448
&gt;&gt; So, uh, I just had
a thought in my head.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:18.516
And so, it's
important to know,

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:22.954
especially if, like, kids
who have cognitive issues,

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.656
you can kind of pinpoint
what's going on

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:26.824
in their environment that
can contribute to those,

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:30.461
versus someone who is,
like, has a predisposition

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:34.899
to have ADD or to have those
kind of cognitive (indistinct).

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.935
So, when you
evaluate people,

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:40.438
you can like see what's
going on in their environment

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.674
that might be a
contributing factor,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.710
and when you change
it, it would--
&gt;&gt; It, it--

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.111
&gt;&gt; It would change
the behavior

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.780
and then actually
that person, you know,

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.648
actually didn't
really have ADD.

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:53.918
It was just because of what was
going on in the environment?

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:55.853
&gt;&gt; That's a hypothesis
that needs to be tested.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.390
This is what the
results suggest,

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:02.994
that definitely need to be
tested in greater detail,

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:04.762
using intervention
designs.

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:08.032
Now, I should note that
there are some youth

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:10.902
who are susceptible, more
susceptible, to media effects.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.737
There's this
differential susceptibility

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:14.839
to media
effects model.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.075
Basically, in a nutshell,
means that youth

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:21.112
who may be most affected
may also be naturally drawn

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:23.181
to this type of
use of media,

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:29.053
so youth who have ADHD
symptoms may be more drawn to,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.522
or use, initially more,
play more video games

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:32.790
that are
fast-paced,

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.058
but we see this
kind of cycle

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:36.327
where they may be
initially drawn to it,

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:39.497
but it is associated with
poor functioning over time.

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.766
So, there's definitely
individual differences here

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:45.837
that need to be studied--
I do want to point that out.

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.740
Thanks for
the question.

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:49.741
Yeah, I'll take
one more question,

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:51.442
then we'll move onto
the next objective.

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.144
&gt;&gt; What age are you
referring to?

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:54.178
&gt;&gt; Those were
young adults.

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:57.548
So, this has not been
studied in children yet,

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.751
and that's definitely
something that needs to happen.

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.619
&gt;&gt; Young adult,
meaning what age?

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:03.121
&gt;&gt; Like college-aged
students.

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:05.023
&gt;&gt; That's what this is?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, mmm-hmm.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.659
So we have a lot
more to study

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:10.094
in terms of what this
looks like in children.

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:12.030
For sure,
great question.

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:18.236
So, the second objective
I had for you for this,

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.804
this presentation is,

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.906
we know that youth are
using media a lot

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:25.410
and we know different ways
that media may affect children,

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:28.246
but when does it
become problematic?

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:34.018
When does it become a
clinical concern, if you will?

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.754
Obviously content matters,
when they use it matters,

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:40.391
but what about
those youth who--

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.360
whose parents say they think
that they may be addicted

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:45.730
to using social media
or using mobile devices?

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:48.700
What's normal
versus not?

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:49.701
Well, in the
literature,

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:53.671
there's been three types
of problematic use defined.

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:57.041
One is this excessive
or addictive-like use,

00:32:57.108 --> 00:33:00.912
use that interferes
with functioning.

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:02.113
Risky use.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.917
So, for example, use
while driving, sexting...

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:10.922
use that can harm the
user themselves or others.

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:13.324
And then,
anti-social use,

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.594
which cyber-victimization,
cyber-bullying would fall under,

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:20.465
use that harms others,
on purpose.

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.168
I should make a
point to say

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:28.072
that a lot of youth spend
a good amount of time

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.474
using screen media,

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.777
and their use doesn't
seem to appear--

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:36.080
interfere, if you will--
with their functioning.

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.282
So, it's not that
all children show

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:42.286
these types of
problematic media use.

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:46.290
It's a small proportion...
but it still matters.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:50.661
We see a lot in the
media, this really--

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:53.164
blowing up of how
media use is all bad,

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.799
and that all kids
can be addicted,

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.134
and that's definitely
not the message

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.102
I want to give
you today.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:59.971
I want to talk about what
are the different ways

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:03.941
and behaviors that may indicate
a problem with using media,

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:06.244
with the caveat
that, for most youth,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.613
it doesn't
become a problem.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.814
So the examples I'm
about to give you

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:14.852
are really more clinical
examples, okay?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.823
So, in terms of
problematic media use,

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.125
most of this research
has been studied

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:24.328
or done in adolescent
populations.

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.832
Pathological gaming, or
video game addiction,

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.668
has been the type of
problematic media use

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:34.372
that's been
studied the most...

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:38.709
so much so that in our
diagnostic manual, in Section 3,

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:41.846
they have an "Internet
Gaming Disorder" listed.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.282
Now, this is not something
I could diagnose right now,

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:48.820
but it's something that they
want to have more research on,

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:52.423
and to see if this is an
actual disorder that exists,

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:55.626
that we'd want to
include in the DSM-6.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.898
Given what I
shared with you

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:05.102
about children at younger
ages using mobile media,

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:07.305
you know, a question
comes up as to,

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:12.043
"Could these symptoms manifest
in children, younger children,

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:16.247
"so children
under age 14?"

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:19.884
So, could we apply
these nine symptoms,

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:23.688
these nine criteria,
to kind of quantifying

00:35:23.754 --> 00:35:27.792
problematic media use
in younger children?

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.528
So, this is where
my second study

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:34.432
that I'll be presenting
today comes in.

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:36.801
My collaborators
and I developed

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:39.337
the "Problematic Media
Use Measure," or "PMUM."

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:41.873
Now, this-- as I mentioned,
these items were generated

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:44.709
based on the criteria of
Internet Gaming Disorder

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.577
in DSM-5,

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.846
and the content used
to generate these items

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:50.882
are questions drawn
from the literature

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:53.150
on problematic
media use.

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:56.187
Clinical experiences,
so working with families

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:59.357
whose children had
issues with gaming

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.291
or other types
of media

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:03.194
that were causing problems
in their lives,

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:06.197
and interviews that we did
with mothers, in Michigan,

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:11.669
about their experiences in
managing excessive use of media.

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.606
60 items were
generated.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.408
We sent them to experts
around the country,

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.043
experts from
different disciplines,

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.979
but who studied
behavioral addictions,

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:25.516
or media-related or screen
media-related addictions

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:29.320
and they gave us feedback
and we revised it.

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:33.791
And this is before we actually
carried out the study.

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.460
To give you
some background,

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:38.329
this is the measure
instructions.

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:41.232
Now, we wanted to
keep it broad enough

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:43.234
so that it could be
used as a screener,

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.136
that clinicians,
pediatricians could use this

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:47.805
as a way to see

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.741
what symptoms were being
endorsed by parents,

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.476
if they needed to talk
to them about it

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:56.247
in more depth
in the office.

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:59.850
So, this is a
parent report form,

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:03.020
and we asked them to think
of any type of screen media

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.823
or devices that
their child uses,

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.391
and we asked them a
variety of questions

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:10.161
that tap into those
nine criteria.

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:13.264
So this is what the PMUM
Short Form looks like.

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:16.834
Nine items, one item
per symptom.

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.235
And so, the types of
questions are not,

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:20.171
"How many hours does
your child use media?"

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:23.708
It's, "What are the
behaviors around media use

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.509
"that may cause problems
in the child's life?"

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.712
So, my child's
screen media use

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.547
interferes with
family activities.

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:31.282
It causes problems
for the family,

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:32.350
the child becomes
frustrated

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.719
when he or she cannot
use screen media.

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:36.587
We heard parents talk
about how the child

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:37.755
won't go to
sleep at night,

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:40.257
in order to
keep gaming.

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:41.659
Refuses to go
to school

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:46.130
in order to keep playing
video games or use a tablet.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.833
When my child has had a bad
day, media is the only thing

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.534
that seems to make him
or her feel better.

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:53.437
So, really, symptoms of
root problematic use--

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:56.107
do you see how this is
different and more clinical

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:57.575
than the typical questions
we may ask

00:37:57.642 --> 00:38:00.945
just about overall
media time?

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.248
So, in terms
of the method--

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:05.616
and this was just
recently published

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:09.120
in the "Psychology of
Popular Media Culture,"

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:11.989
we recruited
parents, mothers,

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:14.325
for the first part
of the study,

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:18.396
ages 4 through 11 years old,
on Amazon Mturk.

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:21.499
They completed the PMUM,
the full measure,

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:25.369
and additional measures
to test validity.

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.771
So, they answered
questions

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.839
as best as they could
about child screen time,

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.876
about if they had concerns
about the child's media use,

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:34.779
and then psychosocial
functioning difficulties

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.781
with the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire,

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:39.517
basically capturing
those subscales

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.819
of potential problems
in the child's life,

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:45.723
so peer relationship problems,
hyperactivity/impulsivity,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.793
emotional symptoms,
and so forth.

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:53.564
We had 291 mothers
who reported

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:57.234
on their youngest
child in the home.

00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:03.107
The most commonly-used media
in this sample was tablet...

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:06.077
not different
from television.

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:09.780
More recently,
television's still

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.084
the most popular
used media,

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.822
but now, it seems that tablets
are reaching same level.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:21.492
69% of children in this sample
owned their own mobile device,

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:24.095
again, you know, showing
how common this is

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:27.164
and that younger ages children
are owning their own devices.

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.799
And on average,
children received

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:31.502
their first mobile
device at age 7.

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:39.176
Average daily screen time was
5.47 hours in this sample.

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:43.147
So, we did a variety of
data reduction analyses

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.149
to select
the items

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.318
that were most consistent
with this concept

00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:51.322
of problematic media use
as an overall factor.

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:54.792
We found, to test
convergent validity,

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:57.128
we looked at correlations
between the PMUM score--

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.196
so how parents reported
on that measure

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:02.833
about children's problematic
media use-- and screen time.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:08.105
And mother-reported worry
about child media use.

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.007
To determine
incremental validity,

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.976
we did multiple
regression analyses

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.578
to determine whether that
measure we developed accounted

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:20.751
for significant variance
in these child's functioning

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:23.954
over and above
screen time.

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.493
Exploratory factor
analyses indicated

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.929
that this was capturing a
unidimensional factor structure,

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:34.532
just meaning that
these symptoms capture

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:38.502
this overall construct
of problematic media use.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:41.038
We selected the three highest
loading items per symptom

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.475
to create a final scale of the
27 items for the full-scale,

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:48.779
and a nine-item version
for the short form.

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:53.450
We saw great internal
reliability

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:56.487
and evidence for
convergent validity...

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:58.622
that higher scores on the
Problematic Media Use Measure

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:01.859
associated with more screen
time, which makes sense.

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:04.662
If parents report
problematic media use,

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:07.598
more likely than not, the
child has a lot of screen time.

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.500
And mothers' own
reported worry

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:12.303
about their
child's media use.

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:17.041
What's really important
is this table, here,

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:19.310
in terms of
incremental validity.

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.579
More often
than not,

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:25.516
pediatricians or even
researchers like myself

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.451
measure or quantify
children's media use

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:30.154
by how many hours
they use screen media.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.455
For a while,
it was just--

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:35.993
number of hours was what
was defined as the problem,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.094
and there have
been guidelines

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:41.365
that pediatricians had about
how many hours was too much.

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.235
And so, typically,
we ask parents,

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.803
"How many hours does your
child you screen media?"

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.272
as a proxy for what
could be a problem

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:51.375
or what could interfere
with a child's functioning.

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:52.977
What we found with
the PMUM is that

00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:55.880
it did a better job in
predicting total--

00:41:55.946 --> 00:42:00.117
in predicting total
dysfunction in a child's life,

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.286
than total amount
of screen time.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.055
So, even when we
controlled for screen time,

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.891
the PMUM score
associated

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:10.327
with overall indices
of child functioning,

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:15.099
indicating that this may be
more valuable or predictive

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.100
than just
asking parents

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:20.204
about how many hours their
child uses screen media.

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:28.712
We confirmed the factor
structure of this scale

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:33.117
in an additional
sample of 600 parents,

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:36.020
and confirmed the
factor structure

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:38.088
in the nine-item
version

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.724
and we found that it works
equally well for boys

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:44.428
and for girls, and also
supported additional analysis

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.897
of convergent
validity.

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:51.502
And so, there are a lot of
strengths to this measure,

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:54.271
and that it's suitable for
children aged 4 to 13.

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:57.007
And up to this point, we
didn't have a measure out there

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.909
that would capture
this addictive-like

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.678
or problematic
use of media.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.346
It was really
specific to adolescents,

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:05.182
so it's looking like,
based on this study,

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:09.753
that this measure could
do a good job at that.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.623
Now, you know,
we see here

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.925
that how children use media
may be more predictive

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:18.762
than how long
they use media,

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.331
but there are several
limitations to this study

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.598
that I want to
point out,

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.600
that I hope that
having this measure

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:28.172
will encourage researchers
to study this further.

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:31.008
We don't know if there
are certain children

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:32.609
who are at more, or
at a greater risk

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:36.347
for excessive or
addictive-like use of media.

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.348
Some people
have posited

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:40.384
that maybe kids with
poor self-regulation

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:43.487
have more problematic
media use.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:46.190
Or does more
problematic media use

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.892
associate with poor
self-regulation,

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.995
or do we find
support for both?

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.496
Like, with the model
I mentioned earlier,

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:55.899
the differential susceptibility
to media effects model,

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.634
that maybe some
children are just--

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.470
with poor emotion
regulation, are more likely

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:02.740
to use media excessively or
mobile devices excessively,

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:04.641
and that, in turn,
takes time away

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:07.611
from those opportunities to
learn how to self-regulate...

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:11.482
and then, associates with
poor self-regulation.

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.450
We don't
know yet.

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.388
We also don't know if these
the behaviors reflect

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:19.823
a distinct
syndrome.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.926
When, you know, my initial
impetus for studying this

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:27.431
was as a result of some of
my clinical experiences.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.467
Could these behaviors
reflect something,

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:33.037
a separate disorder, or is
this just a manifestation

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.572
of symptoms related
to screen media

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:38.609
that is part of a
different disorder,

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:41.845
like ADHD or Autism
Spectrum Disorder?

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.014
We don't know
that yet,

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:46.583
but we do know that parents are
really concerned about this,

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.819
and they want to know if their
children are using media

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.587
in problematic
ways.

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.589
And up to this point,
we weren't really sure

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:57.494
what behaviors best corresponded
to problems in functioning.

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:59.063
But now, we
have something

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:02.032
and I really do hope that
researchers take this

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.901
and validate it
in other samples,

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.937
and see if it does, in
a longitudinal study,

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:09.073
associate with
longer-term outcomes.

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:11.008
&gt;&gt; So, thinking about
this as a predictor

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:15.012
or a co-morbidity
or looking at--

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:20.818
have you looked at the data
on the known percentage

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:24.288
of disorders present
in a population?

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:28.225
So, we know, roughly, how
much media use is reported.

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:31.295
We also know how much
spectrum disorder is incident.

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:35.899
Have you, then, tried
to overlap these data

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:38.035
with that to see,
do they overlap?

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:42.172
Or are they identifying a
distinctly new population?

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.741
&gt;&gt; And that's what we
definitely want to do.

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:47.644
We-- this, again,
was in two samples

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:50.247
that do not represent
the population at hand.

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:54.284
That would be a great research
question, for certain.

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:58.088
We will be testing
this in our--

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:00.290
for children who are
getting treatment

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:02.926
at our ASD
assessment clinic,

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:05.295
to see if we see differences
in problematic media use

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:07.865
in children who have
diagnoses of different types

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:11.168
of different
clinical diagnoses,

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.437
but, yeah, I definitely
think there's more to come.

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:15.739
This was just the
first tiny step.

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:17.908
That's a
great question.

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:22.012
Any other questions
about this measure?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.482
Okay.

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:33.524
So we are also looking at,
"Do those nine symptoms

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:37.227
"also exist for
not just gaming,

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:41.732
"but addictive-like use
of phones in teens?"

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:46.370
Again, similar symptoms,
adolescent report,

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.272
and a future study, we're
going to be looking at

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:51.074
how do these teens--
what are some predictors

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:54.344
of addictive phone use
in adolescents?

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.782
Do we see differences
in adolescents' brains

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:02.986
for those who report being
addicted to phones, versus not?

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:06.823
And so, we have just completed
an fMRI study looking at this,

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:11.094
and I'm happy to share those
results as they emerge.

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:14.164
Again, it's this question
of, is this addiction--

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:18.535
is this behavioral addiction
something that's distinct?

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:23.240
Do the measures that we have
capture this phenomenon?

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:24.875
And so, there's a lot
of work to be done,

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.978
but I'm really
excited about it.

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:35.018
So, in addition to
addictive-like use of media--

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:37.221
we're trying to get at
what makes it problematic.

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:39.890
In addition to the behaviors
that I listed before

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:43.927
and use that interferes
with a child's functioning,

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:47.464
there's also risky
and antisocial use.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.001
Risky use, as I
mentioned before,

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:55.505
is use that can harm the
youth doing the posting.

00:47:55.572 --> 00:47:57.107
We have sexting,
for example,

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.742
or excessive
disclosure,

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.779
or inappropriate sharing
based on norms of peers.

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.383
Whereas, with antisocial use,
it's use that can harm others,

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:10.254
so cyber-bullying,
cyber-victimization,

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.957
trolling or harassing
others online.

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:17.761
We recently developed an
intervention to help teens

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:23.433
who have been hospitalized
for suicide attempts...

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.670
use social media
in healthy ways

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:30.307
and to decrease maladaptive
use that may have

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:34.278
or may not have been related
to some of the depressed mood

00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:37.714
and suicidal ideation
that they endorsed.

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:41.118
Some high-risk adolescents
may use social media

00:48:41.184 --> 00:48:44.421
to post content that includes
threats to commit suicide,

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:47.424
saying good-bye or announcing
plan to commit suicide,

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:51.995
and disclosing sensitive
or private content.

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:56.033
So, in these
examples, you know,

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.368
I want to know,
as a clinician,

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:03.240
what teens-- what my teens are
using in terms of their apps,

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:06.243
but also what they
share, what they post,

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.879
how they make decisions
about what to post...

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:12.883
because some of these
examples of risky use--

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:15.686
obviously, these are
really high-risk examples,

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:17.187
but we also have
teens sharing

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.955
that they post things
that they regret

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.658
that may not reach
this level of severity,

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:25.395
but that they regret later on
and they feel embarrassed about.

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:26.663
And so, what we're
really trying to do

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.299
is help teens use
social media in ways

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:32.803
that is healthy
and protective.

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:35.439
And so, we just developed
an intervention to do that

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.974
and, if I have time at the
end, I'll definitely show you

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.811
the components of
that intervention.

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:44.815
I want to briefly get into
what clinicians can do,

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.116
because I know we have
some clinicians out here

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:48.218
in the audience.

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:49.953
Before I jump
into that,

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.155
I would love to answer any
questions that you have

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:55.892
about how children
use screen media,

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.795
what that may mean
for their development,

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:01.531
when it becomes
problematic.

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.904
Are there any examples
that I didn't share

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:11.842
that you've seen in your lives
about problematic media use,

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:12.843
use that can
get in the way?

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.312
Yeah.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:17.414
&gt;&gt; I guess for, like--
for the children

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:20.851
that don't have parents
that monitor their media use

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:24.988
or have more parental controls
on what they're viewing,

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:26.890
the internet is,
like, you can--

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:29.559
there's a lot of
information to absorb,

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.461
and there's some things that
kids shouldn't be looking at.

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:34.231
And I think, I mean,
kids are exposed

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:35.632
to those kind
of things,

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:41.571
and so, definitely,
expect to, like,

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.240
affect their
brain development

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.742
because being exposed to
adult things that, you know,

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:48.879
a teenager or an adolescent
maybe should not.

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:52.582
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we're
seeing kids at younger ages

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:56.586
exposed to, like, online
pornography, inadvertently,

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.588
because there
aren't controls

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:02.325
put in place
on their devices,

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:04.961
and I have resources for those
of you who work with parents,

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.663
or are parents,
on how to do that.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.299
I'll put them
up at the end.

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:12.602
We'll do you-- yeah?
&gt;&gt; I had a question,

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:15.572
when it comes to kids,
you know, using media

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.207
and with
binging stuff,

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:21.578
with everything these days
being digital and electronic,

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:25.515
do you think like keeping
your kids away from media,

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:29.319
and anything like that,
would that set them behind

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:32.355
since other kids will
be using it a lot?

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.890
And when they, when
everything's going

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.225
to computers
and stuff,

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.894
and kind of like you teach
your grandpa how to text,

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:39.229
with computers.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.564
&gt;&gt; Do you think that
would put those kids

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.300
a little bit behind the kids
that are always using media

00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:44.868
and digital
stuff?

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:48.038
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think it
depends on the age

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:51.041
and there's a lot of different
thoughts I have about this.

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:57.581
For one, really young
children quickly learn.

00:51:57.647 --> 00:52:01.184
They learn how to use
technology very, very quickly.

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:03.019
I'm not so concerned
about them

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:08.124
not being able to know
how to use a laptop

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.159
when they're in
kindergarten,

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.161
if they haven't been exposed
to it right out of the womb.

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.530
I'm not concerned
about that.

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:18.001
For teens, though, most of
their social interactions

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:20.770
and their social
world is online.

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.540
And so, I would
hesitate to say,

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:28.612
"No media
for kids,"

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.180
because that could take
away an opportunity

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:32.616
for them to interact
with others,

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.951
because a lot of kids
use it in healthy ways.

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:37.787
I think it should be
seen as more like...

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:38.889
like how we
teach kids

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:42.792
on how to eat healthy
foods, in moderation.

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:45.629
It should be seen as something
that's part of our lives

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:47.797
that we can't necessarily
get away from,

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:52.469
but children can learn how
to use it in adaptive ways,

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:54.871
in moderation,

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.606
but we also have to get
buy-in from parents

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.141
because it's also
tough for us

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:01.745
to put away our mobile devices
and to not always be on it.

00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:06.116
So I think there's a lot
more that can be done

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:07.384
by the adults
in this world

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:11.254
to shape children's use of
media in ways that are healthy.

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:13.023
It's a great question--
yeah?

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.691
&gt;&gt; Mine is similar
to that,

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:18.128
but has your research or
anyone else's research

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:21.398
showed what would
be kind of, sort of,

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:24.568
the appropriate age for
a child to have a phone?

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.736
Like, I see some
6-year-olds

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.004
and I think that's
ridiculous,

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:32.375
but is there kind of
an appropriate age?

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:35.312
&gt;&gt; Well, they-- the American
Academy of Pediatrics

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:37.347
has some guidelines
on this.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:43.186
For children, you know,
zero to 1.5, 2,

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:46.790
having access to
mobile technology

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:49.159
if it facilitates
social interactions

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:51.394
with a loved one
is okay.

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:54.197
So, if a child wants
to Skype with Grandma,

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:55.966
that's one thing,

00:53:56.032 --> 00:54:00.103
and just in terms of
exposure to any screens.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:05.141
There's a move away from
giving exact age limits

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.810
or age
recommendations

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:10.280
because it's not
so much the device,

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:14.751
it's what they see,
how they use it,

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.486
versus it just
being present.

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.655
So it depends
on a lot

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:21.791
and it's kind of growing
to be something that we,

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:26.262
as clinicians and educators,
need to be able to talk

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:29.666
to parents about over time,
and as a child grows,

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:32.168
to determine what would
be best for that child.

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.937
And there's
some children,

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:36.306
like we found with that
measure I developed,

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.274
that may just
have a propensity

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:41.311
to be really, really engaged
to a problematic level

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:43.146
with certain
types of media.

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.682
You know, I really
want to know what happens

00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:49.119
to those kids in school when
there's screens all around

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:50.854
and what that means
for their functioning.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.922
And so, it also
could depend

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.258
on a child's individual
characteristics.

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:56.860
There's some children
that just...

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:59.863
just not really that
interested in mobile devices.

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:00.830
They want to
play outside.

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:03.266
And so, the answer
is, it depends

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:06.002
and it takes a lot of
thinking to determine

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:09.739
what would be appropriate
for your own child.

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.474
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; I had a question.

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.476
You talked about
three items,

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:16.346
on media use and
time displacement.

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.248
You know, are there
guidelines or benchmarks

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:22.552
for what an item is that
could be beneficial,

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:25.388
like to
compare it to?

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:27.090
&gt;&gt; Can you explain
that one more time?

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:29.025
&gt;&gt; Like, as far as
time displacement.

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:32.362
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, time spent not
doing something else,

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:35.765
is there like a guideline for
what is considered beneficial

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.767
and how much time we
should have doing that,

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.903
where you should be
beyond the both?

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:44.708
&gt;&gt; It is-- again,
the policy is

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:47.844
to move away from giving
exact time limits.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.879
It should be a balance
and moderation

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.815
throughout the
child's day.

00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:54.484
That child should be engaged
in a variety of activities

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.352
that promote their
development,

00:55:56.419 --> 00:56:01.991
so a portion of that
may be some screen time.

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:04.728
But it's important that they
have opportunities to play,

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:05.962
and to get
exercise,

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:09.999
and to interact with people
in their environment.

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:12.836
What the American Academy of
Pediatrics has, right now,

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:16.573
I can show you
real quick,

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:21.377
is a family
media use plan.

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:25.949
And that's a great way
to start figuring out

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:31.821
what would be best
for your own family.

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:36.126
So, if you guys want to take a
picture this with your phone.

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:38.161
(chuckling)

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:45.001
The first website,
right there,

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.370
is-- and I don't know if
I can get internet access,

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.840
but basically
what it does is,

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:54.377
has you create goals
for your family.

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:56.913
It could be-- and it may
not be specific to time.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.716
It may be, "Let's not have
devices at dinner time

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:02.886
"for three of the
nights this week."

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:06.289
And it has you select
the different age range,

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.524
age ranges of
your children.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.993
And so, you can set up
different plans for your family

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:11.261
or for families
that you work with.

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.395
It's great.

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:15.165
Again, they did
this because it's--

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:18.234
we can't give, like, black
and white answers anymore

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:21.938
about what's, like,
the amount of time

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:25.375
that beyond which
is problematic.

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.810
I mean, it's
too simplistic

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.946
because, for some kids, it
could be less amount of time.

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:31.281
For other kids, it could
be more amount of time.

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:33.383
It's more about how they
use it and what they see.

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:36.653
The content is what
really matters.

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.655
&gt;&gt; For those that are trying
to take a picture here,

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:42.125
this entire presentation will
be online early next week,

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:44.294
through the Psychology
Department website,

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.362
so you'll be able
to scroll forward,

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.031
and you, too, can get
to this thing, so.

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:52.435
&gt;&gt; Awesome, I'll also put this
up on my website as well.

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.103
&gt;&gt; There are some questions.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, hi.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.271
&gt;&gt; I just want to go
back to your comment

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:56.806
about risky behavior
in adolescents.

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:59.943
I'm a former health
teacher in high school,

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.978
and one of the areas that
I was aware of near the end

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:05.415
of my teaching career
is using social media,

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.383
especially
the internet,

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:13.790
to get information about how
to design substances for use.

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:19.362
So how to-- god--
intensify their usage

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:21.965
of different types of drugs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:25.535
So that, there are
some projects

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:28.438
that are being funded
by the NIH, right now,

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:31.975
to look at-- and I didn't speak
about that in terms of content,

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:37.747
but content related to
seeing risky behaviors,

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:42.452
whether it's consuming
alcohol, using drugs,

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:45.688
promoting or normalizing
alcohol or drug use

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:50.326
or other
substances.

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:52.562
It's really powerful,
through social media,

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:57.000
and so what the researchers who
are experts, in that domain,

00:58:57.066 --> 00:59:00.503
are looking at, how does
viewing these types of content

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.838
and social media
affect youth?

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:04.707
We do see some evidence
that it does associate

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:07.510
with earlier
initiation and use,

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.145
but that's also--
when I say "content,"

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:12.315
it could be any
type of content

00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:14.217
you wouldn't want your
adolescent to see

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:16.586
that can influence
their behaviors

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:20.089
in those different
health domains.

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:22.425
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; I have a question on

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:25.295
if parents actually are
engaged in asking questions

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:27.297
versus their child
asking questions.

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.765
Does that-- like,
what kind of difference

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:29.866
does it
actually make?

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:32.402
Is it just a like a continuum,
because I imagine no screen time

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.804
is still probably
idyllic, right,

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:37.407
and then maybe the
parent being engaged,

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.175
versus not so much?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.677
&gt;&gt; So we--
&gt;&gt; Or, kids by themselves?

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:43.713
&gt;&gt; We actually don't know a
whole lot about differences

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.183
when children elicit-- like
elicit the active mediation,

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.052
versus parents
eliciting it.

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:51.054
This is something,
to our knowledge,

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.156
hasn't been
studied.

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:55.491
And that's why it was one of
our themes in our research.

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.926
It was like, "Wow, this
is really interesting.

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:57.994
"Children are
asking for this

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.195
"or trying to get it
from their parents,"

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.998
so we don't know about
those differences.

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:05.568
It could be that children
who are more verbal

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:09.072
or have better communication
with their parents

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.074
may be doing this, and
so they may already have

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.543
some protective factors
related to media use,

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.511
so it'd be really
interesting to see

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:18.581
what child factors may
be at play in children

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:22.785
who are getting more of
that active mediation.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:25.788
You know, from a
clinician standpoint,

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:29.959
I want to know what the
child's favorite shows are,

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:33.129
their favorite websites,
their favorite apps.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.597
If the parents
don't know that,

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.733
then that's a moment
of intervention

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.668
where I can do some
psychoeducation on that,

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.137
and talk to them about
some of this research.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.706
With teens, I love asking
them about what types of apps

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:47.243
they like to use, what's
their favorite social media,

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.980
you know, who do they
follow on social media?

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.281
A lot of them
follow celebrities,

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.516
so that can kind of
give me some insight

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.852
into what their
interests are.

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.987
So there's a lot of questions
that we could be asking

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.824
in the clinical arena
to help understand

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.526
where these
adolescents are at

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:07.130
and what they may be seeing
that could be risky for them.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.998
&gt;&gt; I guess I was thinking
more like the younger kids,

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.566
with cognitive
development, right,

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.001
it could make a
big difference

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.704
to our trying to engage
them more socially,

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.072
and ask them, like--
think about,

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.306
"Oh, what happened
to that character?"

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:18.908
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or, "What would you do?"

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:22.311
&gt;&gt; We know that kids who
have active mediation,

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:25.281
even if the content is
pro-social or educational,

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:29.385
have better effects of
seeing that type of content,

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.386
so it's a
good thing.

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.822
We definitely want
parents to be more engaged

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:36.426
and talking about pro-social
and educational content as well

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.062
'cause we do see positive
outcomes for those kids.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.530
&gt;&gt; It's still better
to read a book, right,

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:41.731
and talk about
that, versus...

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:43.966
&gt;&gt; Umm...

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:47.103
there's some--
I definitely think

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.706
kids should be read
to every day,

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:54.577
but there are some
great programs

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.179
that do teach
children some things.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.781
I mean, if that's
a possibility,

01:01:58.848 --> 01:01:59.982
if you can read
a book, great,

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.618
but I think for a lot
of families, it's--

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.821
children have to be
with their screens.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:08.124
And so, we have to do
harm reduction approaches

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.259
in today's
age, so.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.095
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:14.397
What other question?

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:17.233
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry-- I
didn't see you back there.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.937
&gt;&gt; In relation to screen time
and children with ADHD,

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:25.274
is it harmful to not have
that outlet for them,

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:29.712
for like-- I'm not saying
video games or I'm not saying--

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.048
I'm saying just to give
them something to do

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.617
with their energy
and all their--

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:37.887
I mean, I understand how
the gaming could be harmful,

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:41.190
but is it possible to take
away that outlet for it?

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.592
&gt;&gt; I--
&gt;&gt; Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:45.695
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would work
with the parents

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:50.366
around other outlets for the
child that they enjoy as well,

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:55.238
that would involve peers
and things that are--

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.873
aspects of where they're
at in their development

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:00.810
that I want them to
be on target with.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:06.883
&gt;&gt; One more, so
let's say it's--

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.620
maybe someone in the
audience sees this information,

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:15.391
and says, "Okay, my kid
is on media too much."

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.660
If they have been
doing it for a while,

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.695
could it be harmful, kind
of like an addiction,

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:22.665
to just go home and say,
"Okay, from now on"--

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:26.302
could that lead
to bad behavior

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:29.705
or is it something you might
want to slowly wean down?

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:32.708
&gt;&gt; So, like in terms
of too much use,

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.077
what I-- and so, that's
actually one of the symptoms

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.413
that was on that
measure, remember,

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.482
was about how it
was really hard

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.918
to get their child away
from screen media use.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.386
So parents that may
have tried this

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.121
and it just did
not go well.

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:48.524
So, as a clinician, what
I would do is come up

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.792
with some sort of
a treatment plan

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.228
that would reduce the
amount of screen time

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:55.498
and increase other types
of enjoyable activities,

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:58.367
or set limits on the child
can get the screen time

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:02.872
when these things
are completed.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:03.906
It's really tough,

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.375
especially with adolescents
and social media.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.511
When things go wrong on
social media for adolescents,

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.713
they're really-- they really
don't want to share that

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.949
with adults 'cause they
don't want to lose access

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.451
to social media because
that is their social world.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.653
So that's, I think,
even more challenging,

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.323
is to figure out
how can we manage

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:21.891
the social media
of adolescents

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:25.561
who may have done harmful
things on social media,

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:30.366
but yet, still allow them to
have some sort of social outlet.

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.901
And it's
really tricky

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:34.937
and I think clinicians are
going to be more tasked

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:38.908
with working with
families on these issues.

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:42.044
And we need training in this
because this is not something

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:45.982
that we're trained on in
our doctoral programs.

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.821
Any other questions
about the studies?

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:53.556
I really just wanted to
show you some studies

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:58.060
that kind of showcased
where my research is going.

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:02.531
Observational methods,
passive sensing,

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:05.801
is gonna be so critical
for studying media use,

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:08.437
over the
next decade,

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:10.006
because, as you saw,
in those households,

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:14.777
it's really hard to quantify
what children are seeing.

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:15.978
So, I'm excited
to do that

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.714
and see how adolescents
use their mobile devices,

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:19.715
what apps
they're using,

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.785
what types of apps may
be more problematic

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:25.688
for sleep
and bedtime,

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.391
and if that, in turn, has
an impact on their health

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:31.027
and their academic
functioning, over time.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.995
So, we'll be starting up
that longitudinal study

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.598
next semester.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:37.667
And then,
seeing more--

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:40.169
learning more about that
problematic media use,

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:42.672
trying to understand what
problematic media use looks

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:46.008
in clients coming
through my door

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:50.646
or children of different--
with different diagnoses.

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:54.650
Yeah, I can
definitely talk more

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.886
about what I recommend
to clinicians if--

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.989
because I know we have some
clinicians in the audience,

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.123
or if you guys have
more questions,

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.793
I'm happy to
answer more.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:09.665
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; As a clinician,

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.200
based on some of
the research,

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.769
our recommendation that
we usually give

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:16.072
is no more than two hours
of screen time,

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.808
not including
homework.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:24.280
Is that kind of where most
clinicians are selling that

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:28.217
or do you see
a spectrum of--

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.353
and, again, I know
it's not an exact time,

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.687
an exact number.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.589
&gt;&gt; It's just like
you said, it's a "how,"

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.424
but to start to
set some boundaries

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:40.396
on their kids-- is that
kind of a reasonable?

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.666
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't even
talk about hours.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.202
I think-- at least with the
mothers that we interviewed,

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.203
they hear that
and they're like,

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:48.637
"Eh, it doesn't
matter how much time

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:52.508
"because my child's
watching positive content."

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.478
I don't know
if families--

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:59.648
at least the families that
I may come in contact with,

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:02.084
have like the schedule
all planned out

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.786
for when the child
can view screen time.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.288
A lot of it's dependent
on different factors

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.290
in their lives,

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.960
so I would rather you talk
to them about the content,

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:16.098
and the internet controls
they have in place,

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.234
when the child
uses screens.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.069
"Do they watch TV
during mealtime?

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.203
"Do they have TV
in the bedroom?"

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:24.407
Those are the questions that
I think are most important.

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.142
I don't know if
asking parents--

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:32.248
telling parents two hours
a day is meaningful

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.216
to some families
anymore,

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:35.885
because I don't know if
they could even tell you

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:40.756
how many hours a day
their child uses media.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.491
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It seems to me

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:47.329
that it's not gonna make
a, well, much difference

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:50.666
for a parent to try and monitor
the total amount of screen time

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.435
if the parent is equally
addicted, because they--

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:53.569
&gt;&gt; That's another point.

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.771
&gt;&gt; The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree,

01:07:55.838 --> 01:08:00.976
and if the child doesn't have
those boundaries on them,

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.511
it's because parents
haven't imposed them

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.947
and the parents are
also as much engaged.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.782
&gt;&gt; Exactly-- and so-- and
that's the other thing,

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.785
especially with the
observational study

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:12.188
that I told
you all about.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.857
A lot of parents are spending
many hours using media

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.125
or their mobile devices
themselves,

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:19.695
so it's becoming an issue
of reporting and monitoring,

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:23.799
and I think we're gonna rely
more on technology itself

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.668
to help us manage
technology.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.537
And there are some
initiatives out there

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:33.476
from social media giants
to act more quickly

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.645
when bad things are
being broadcasted live.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.949
Still a long way to go,
but I do think

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:43.486
that we'll have to partner
more with technologists

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:49.391
to create interventions that
parents can use automatically

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:53.162
to reduce some of
the negative effects.

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.934
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.636
&gt;&gt; Dr. Domoff will be
here for a little while,

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.671
so if you want
to speak with her

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.074
in the next 10,
15 minutes, feel free.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.075
Thank you all
for coming.

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.477
Let's give her a hand
for sharing her research.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:11.046
(applause)

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:12.748
As I stand up here
with a media device,

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:16.418
mostly 'cause I just don't have
that good a memory anymore,

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.454
suggesting that I ever did.
(audience laughing)

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.389
But for those of you
from the community,

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:23.225
those of you who are going
to be around next semester,

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.294
just to let you know what
we're gonna have coming up

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.496
in the Speaker
Series, then.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:29.532
Dr. Jeff Nevid is
going to be here.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.667
Those of you who might be
in General Psych, right now,

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.869
if you take a look
at your textbook,

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:36.171
you'll see the same name, so
it is actually the author

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.174
of the General Psych textbook
we're using right now.

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.310
And Dr. Nevid
does research

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.613
around unconscious
decision-making.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.549
And so, his
presentation is

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:49.518
"Unmasking the Automatic Mind--
Toward a New Understanding

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.587
"of Unconscious
Cognition,"

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.890
so when you make decisions
and you don't even know

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.760
what cognitions are
influencing your decision.

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.662
And then, the second one,
actually, is complementary

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.196
to the one that
we just saw.

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:02.898
It's Dr. Brian Gibson.

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:06.168
And Dr. Gibson is going
to be talking about,

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:11.140
more, the cognitive
effects of media.

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:14.376
His presentation is "Media
Effects-- Can Watching TV

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:17.580
"or Playing Video Games
Really Change How You Think

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.715
"and What You Do?"

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:23.786
So, Dr. Nevid's presentation
is on Wednesday, February 14th,

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:28.524
and Dr. Gibson is on
Thursday, March 22nd.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:31.026
They're always
from 1:00 to 2:30.

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.027
So, thank you
for coming,

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.863
and, again, if you
wish to ask questions,

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.900
feel free to come up
and talk to Dr. Domoff.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.268
Thank you.
